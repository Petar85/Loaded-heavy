      <p class="col-9">I studied Tourism while living in my hometown of Uzice, Serbia. After completing my degree, I moved to Northern Ireland for three months to attend a training program focusing on community building in conflict areas. When I came back to Serbia, I interned at a local hostel, but with the suffering economy was unable to attain a full time position in the tourism trades. I have traveled through Europe, especially in the Balkan region, before moving to Washington's Puget Sound at the end of 2014.

        

        For the last five years I have worked as a Foreman's assistant installing and servicing natural gas to residential homes. I learned the value of hard labor, to collaborate well with a team, and the importance of following procedure. In July of this year, the company shutdown. I am taking this time to look for new opportunities in IT.
